# Beat Saber Mapping Tools
A simple set of tools for making Beat Saber maps
## What is this project?
At the moment, just a collection of calculators and tools to help with some of the more annoying aspects of mapping. The entire tool is designed to run on your local machine, so your save files are always in your hands.
## What does it include?
### Brightness Adjustment
#### Simple
Multiply all colors' brightness values by a single multiplier
#### Per Channel *(most likely useless, but just in case)*
Multiply each color channel's brightness (red, green, and blue) by their own multiplier
#### Per Color
Multiply specific colors' (by hex codes) by their own brightness multiplier
## Help wanted
If you have anything you'd like to contribute or add, please do! This is really just a pet project for my own use, but if you stumbled across it, hopefully it helped you too.
